The purpose of the modeling was to evaluate the effectiveness of a berm located southeast of Suwannee Street and the train tracks.', 'Comparison of the modeled sound levels to a community noise ordinance was not included as part of our analysis.  We modeled the impact of the Amphitheater portable sound system on the community to the south and southeast of the park with and without a 10 foot, 20 foot, and 30 foot berm.  This report summarizes the modeling results and analysis. Analysis of the speaker placement of the portable system will be submitted under a separate report.', '', 'Sound Level Basics', 'When dealing with sound, there is the physical quantity which is expressed as sound level and the perceived level which is expressed as loudness.  Sound level is measured in units called decibels', '(abbreviated dB).  Decibels are power ratios and are logarithmic quantities.  Audible sound occurs over a wide frequency range, from approximately 20 Hertz (Hz) to 20,000 Hz.  Human hearing does not respond equally to sounds at different frequencies (or pitch).  Lower frequency sounds that are equally as loud have a much higher decibel level than high frequency sounds.  To accommodate this variation in frequency sensitivity of human hearing, a frequency weighting can be applied to sound level measurements.  When the weighting is applied, the resulting sound level measurements are said to be A-weighted and the decibel level is abbreviated dBA.', 'When the sound energy doubles, the decibel value increases by 3 dB.  Human hearing is also logarithmic and when the perceived loudness of a sound is doubled, the corresponding sound level increases by approximately 10 dBA.  In fact, a qualified listener cannot detect a change in sound level of 1 dBA.  The average listener starts to detect a change in level at 3 dBA, and a clearly noticeable change occurs at 5 dBA, as summarized below in Table 1:', '', 'Acoustics By Design, Inc.

Acoustics By Design is a professional engineering firm based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  We are an independent firm and have no affiliation with any manufacturers, suppliers, or installers.', '', 'Sound System Description:', 'There is an existing house system that was installed as part of the original construction.  There are 4 loudspeakers mounted on the main truss to cover the lower seating areas of the venue.  The speakers point down from the truss in order to direct more high frequency sound onto the audience area.  The input that we have received so far indicates that this system is not typically used for most events in the space.  Instead, a portable system is used for the vast majority of', 'non-touring events that go on at the facility.  This system is set up by parks and rec staff for each intended event.  The portable system utilizes small-format direct-radiating devices with the speakers on stands placed on stage and generally pointed straight out toward the listening area.', 'For larger ticketed events a touring sound system is brought into the space and used.  The use and impacts of the touring sound system are not addressed as part of this report.  This report is primarily intended to address the portable system and its impacts.', 'Discussion:', 'It has been reported that on some occasions sound projected from the portable system on the stage has an undesirable audible impact on some neighboring properties.  The primary locations where this has been a problem are located to the south of the amphitheater.  The stage faces', '', '124 East Fulton, Second Floor, Grand Rapids, MI  49503', '', 'Phone (616) 241-5810, Fax (877) 603-5781 (cid:1)  www acousticsbydesign com', '', 'Acoustics By Design, Inc. (cid:1) Consultants in Acoustics and Technical Systems', '', '', '', '', '', 'City of Tallahassee  Cascades Park Amphitheater', 'Page 2', 'April 27, 2015', '', 'southeast.  In general, in order to reduce the impact to neighboring properties, speakers should be pointed away from the south as much as possible.  This is more important when 2 or more speakers are placed on one side or if the speaker on the northeast side of the stage is angled to cover across the space.  As much as possible, all sound should be directed more east than south.', 'Beyond pointing the speakers away from the south, it is important to try and limit the vertical dispersion of sound from the site.  Higher frequencies can be more easily controlled than low frequencies.  Frequency control requires the use of large horns or devices stacked into a vertical array.  The larger the horn or array in the vertical plane, the lower the frequency that is effectively controlled.  Direct radiating speakers such as the QSC K12 used in the portable system have very small horns (for the high frequencies only) and therefore a limited ability to control the sound.  Alternate speakers will be discussed further in the recommendations portion of this report.', 'In general, the contours of the site work to try and block the speaker spill to neighboring areas, largely because the portable speakers are at a lower elevation than the properties and the bowl of the amphitheater provides some shadowing of sound.  In order for the contours to be helpful, the speakers should direct as much sound as possible down on to the listening area and the site contours should be as high as possible.  See our acoustical report for more detail and discussion on this point.', 'A suggestion to place loudspeakers to the side of the audience area or behind the audience area has also been made.  Placing loudspeakers to the sides or behind the seating area is not an option.', 'From an audience perspective, sound coming from a different location than where the performer or presenter is located is a bad experience and very disconnected for the listener.  The more the speakers are behind the audience the worse the listening experience is.  Additionally, any speakers that might be placed on the north side of the audience area would be directing sound to the south  pointing in exactly the wrong direction.', 'Recommendations:', 'As a general rule, the portable system speakers should never be pointed toward the south side of the amphitheater.  At all times sound should be directed away from the south as much as possible.  However, even when this general guideline is followed the existing portable system loudspeakers do not have sufficient directivity and control when utilized on poles at the stage to direct the sound away from the neighboring properties.', 'The lower directivity speaker sends a large percentage of the energy up into the air and toward the neighboring properties.  A better implementation of sound reinforcement would be to employ a highly directional speaker placed as low on the stage as possible and directing sound in a minimal vertical plane toward the intended listening area.  This configuration of highly directional speaker and low elevation can be effective at distributing sound evenly across the space and at limiting the audio spill to the neighboring areas.  See our acoustical report for more details and recommendations on the site and berms.', 'There are numerous manufacturers that make highly directive loudspeakers.

The current curtain system at the amphitheater consists of 10 panels that are made of 27-ounce Charisma 1064 fabric.  Four panels are hung from the truss at the back of the stage, two panels are hung on each side and two panels are used to wrap the truss system towers.  However, there is not a setup template that works for all concerts, wind conditions, technical specs of producing the show and sightlines all play a role.  We have asked Mr. Carswell to work with the artists stage manager and include all 10 panels unless technical setup requirements of the band mandate otherwise.  In addition, wind conditions above a certain level can also force side panels to be adjusted in order to avoid disrupting the performance.  To date, we have determined that the full curtain system was utilized 87% of the time for the seven concerts.', '', 'In order to continue to work with the neighborhoods on sounds issues, we are requesting that', 'Blueprint purchase two additional half-curtain panels (one for the east side of the stage and one for the west) that would be hung in place of a full panel, if production requirements do not allow for full panels.  These half-panels, in conjunction with the stage walls, will assist with sound mitigating from the stage area.  To help with possible wind concerns, these half panels will be anchored to certain points on the stage or the stage walls.  The estimated cost of the half-curtain panels and storage for the curtains are approximately 4,000.', '', 'We hope that this additional purchase and setup requirement will be satisfactory to the Cascades', 'Park Working Group.

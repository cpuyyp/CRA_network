- output7_new_sentiment.csv
CSV files with emails, with the following columns: 
,From,Sent,To,CC,Subject,Attachments,Importance,Body,textblob_sentiment,nltk_sentiment,flair_sentiment,GCP_sentiment
Note: sentiments are precomputed and can be used as metadata. That does not mean that sentiment is reliable. Sentiment
was computed in three ways (NLTK, FLAIR< GCP). Ask Joey for interpretation. He should have this written up somewhere. 

- filter.py
I (Gordon) wrote this program to process the output7_new_sentiment file. The objective was to fix errors in the csv file. 
Many emails have no subject, and the first line of the email is the subject by mistake. This is partially fixed in filter.py

The bearing soil was found to be unsuitable to build the foundation of the elevator due to water migration(See attached pictures). Please provide direction how we are to proceed with this foundation installation.    Reference ]yes Signed: Attachments no            Design Team Response      To avoid the potential of undermining the building structure by removing the two to three feet of poor material below the elevator foundation as suggested, the contractor shall install four new steel helical piles as located on the attached sketch. The piles shall be rated for an allowable load of 25 kips each and shall be adorn with a new construction cap. The top of pile shall extend 2\" into the bottom of the footing. Priorto installing the piles the contractor shall remove as much water as possible from the excavation, remove approximately 8\" ofthe top loose material and provide a working surface out oftamped graded aggregate or flowable fill. An additional foundation grade beam {discussed in the field) will not be required due to the rieiditv of the concrete stem wall.          ASI Signed: Patrick M.

Bubba Newborry Today at 7:12 PM  To Brooks Hayes CC Myron Newb  Brooks, Sorry. too many misc. attachments not directly related in main email string. #1 Just to Con?rm receipt of your correspondence.  #2 We figured all 25 gauge framing per plans.  l?ll get this framing modification change priced up quickly as possible,  If it was only 2093 upgrade we could possibly handle it as a good-faith no~cost change  But, a switch to 16 heavy gauge framing with added clips and fasteners ltapcons. etc.) is a different story.  We?ll get it fairly priced up as a change order cost ASAP.  Have a good evening. Thank You,  Bubba N.  cc: file: est.  FYI: Please see attached Response for Knee Wall.
